              - [ ] Does the PR do what it intends to do?
              - [ ] Except for very minor changes, is a changelog entry included and consistent with the [changelog guide](https://docs.plasmapy.org/en/latest/contributing/changelog_guide.html)?
              - [ ] Are the continuous integration checks passing? (Most linter problems can be automagically fixed by commenting on this PR with `pre-commit.ci autofix`.)
            - Code
              - [ ] Is new/updated code readable and consistent with the [coding guide](https://docs.plasmapy.org/en/latest/contributing/coding_guide.html)?
              - [ ] Can any large functions be split up into shorter functions that each do one thing?
              - [ ] Are SI units used?
            - Tests
              - [ ] Are tests added/updated as required, and consistent with the [testing guide](https://docs.plasmapy.org/en/latest/contributing/testing_guide.html)?
              - [ ] Are the tests understandable?
              - [ ] Do the tests cover all important cases?
            - Docs
              - [ ] Are docs added/updated as required, and consistent with the [doc guide](https://docs.plasmapy.org/en/latest/contributing/doc_guide.html)?
              - [ ] Are the docs understandable?
              - [ ] Do the docs show up correctly in the preview, including Jupyter notebooks?`
